# motionbot

The bot with strong opinions about how your meeting should run.

# Quick start

* Op the bot. Do it.
* Do something like the following as an op yourself:

> !start meeting
> !quorum 42

* Voice those people you wish to be able to vote, or op them.
* You may also `!add <nick>` to have the bot persist their voice for dropouts.
* Do a motion, like so:

> !motion This is the text of my motion.
> !start motion

* Recognised people (ops, voiced) then say "aye", "nay" or "abstain" here.
* Ops may add a `!ayes <n>` and `!nays <n>` if including votes from an external source, such as physical delegates in a room.

* To stop the motion and tally results:

> !stop motion

* To cancel a motion for any reason:

> !cancel motion

* To end the meeting, kill the bot or:

> !stop motion
